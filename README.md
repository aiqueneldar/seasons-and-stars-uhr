### Calendar of the Uhr
Each week is 6 days, each day simply named First day through Sixth day.  
This is when the smallest moon sync up with the middle moon, and the double full moon constitutes the end of the week.

Each month is made up of 8 weeks (48 days) and is when the largest moon have made a rotation and is synced up with the two smaller moons.  
When this happens it will be during the new moon for all three moons, making it a very dark night as such superstition has it this is a night of dark tidings.
